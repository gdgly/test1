# Note: The mib XtalCalibrationParameters is used to configure the XTAL
#       calibration alogorithm. This consists of three settings per XTAL power
#       mode (ULP, LP and LN) of:
#         Min Bias - Minimum Bias setting allowed
#         Max Bias - Maximum Bias setting allowed
#         Target Threshold - Threshold crossing at which the bias is selected
# 
#       An additional globally applied option is provided for selecting the
#       bias prior to, or after, crossing below the comparator target threshold
#
#       This MIB uses an array of ten octets defined as follows:
#        Octets 0-2 - ULP mode Min Bias, Max Bias and Target Threshold resp.  
#        Octets 3-5 - LP mode Min Bias, Max Bias and Target Threshold resp.
#        Octets 6-8 - LN mode Min Bias, Max Bias and Target Threshold resp.
#        Octet 9 - Bit 0 - Increment bias after below Target Threshold reached. 
#        Octet 9 - Bits 7:1 - Reserved.
#
#       In simple terms, the calibration algorithm comprises the following
#       sequence steps for each XTAL power mode:
#         - starts with a bias setting of Max Bias
#         - calculates a comparator value based on the XTAL amplitude measurements
#           for the current bias setting
#         - if the comparator value is greater than the Target Threshold, and the
#           current bias is greater than the Min Bias, then the bias value is 
#           decremented and the previous step executed.
#         - if the above calibration loop exits because the Min Bias has been 
#           reached, then the Min Bias value shall be selected for the XTAL
#           power mode being calibrated.
#         - if the loop exits because the comparator value has gone below the
#           Target Threshold, then the current bias value is selected for the
#           XTAL power mode being calibrated. This bias value can, however, be 
#           optionally incremented (via the Octet 9 Bit 0 setting) to ensure that 
#           the final bias corresponds to a comparator value >= Target Threshold
#           rather than one which is < Target Threshold.
#
#       The recommended settings for Aura 2.0 are:
#          ULP - statically set: OSC_ULP_BIAS_TRIM = 7
#          LP  - dynamically set: 8 < OSC_ULP_BIAS_TRIM < 20 with a Target 
#                Threshold of 85.
#          LN  - statically set: OSC_BIAS_TRIM = 10

# Note: The mib XtalPowerModeStateSettings is used to enable dynamic XTAL power
#       mode transitioning between different power modes depending on the
#       device's current operational configuration with respect to:
#        - PLL operation - 'Or'-ing of the System PLL and MClk PLL Off/On states
#        - Always-on-Voice (AOV) - Off/On state
#        - Audio Analogue Clock (AAC) - Off/On state
#        - BT sub-system - Disabled/Enabled state
#
#       The above thus gives 16 possible combinations for which one of the 
#       following four XTAL power modes is selectable,:
#         0 - Low Power (LP)
#         1 - Low Power without current boost (LPX)
#         2 - Low Power without current boost and LN regulator (LPXX)
#         3 - Low Noise (LN)
#
#       N.B. The above power modes are set per nibble in the 8 octet length MIB 
#            key.
#
#       As an example, the following MIB key settings of:
#
#       XtalPowerModeStateSettings = [02 01 02 01 00 00 00 00]
#
#       equates to:
