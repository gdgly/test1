MIB keys are required to support Puya parts on QCC512x devices. There are
no Puya QSPI parts with ROM support on QCC512x.


The following QSPI parts cannot perform quad reads at 80MHz. On CSRA68105 devices,
the 80 or 120MHz clock source is divided by 2. QCC512x and QCC514x devices do
not use the clock divider and therefore the SqifClockControl MIB key must be
configured such that these QSPI parts use the 32MHz crystal clock source.
