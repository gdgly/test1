MIB keys are required to support EON/ESMT parts on QCC512x devices. There are
no EON/ESMT QSPI parts with ROM support on QCC512x.

Although MIB keys are supplied for EN25S16B(2S) and EN25S80B(2S), they should not
be used because they require a resume to suspend delay of 5ms (according to 
their datasheets). Revised parts expected Q2/Q3 2019.

EON/ESMT flash parts use alternative suspend/resume commands. The Application
filesystem (fw_cfg_filesystem) on QCC512x devices equipped with ESMT flash 
parts must contain the following entry:

SiflashSuspendResumeCommands = 0xb030b030
