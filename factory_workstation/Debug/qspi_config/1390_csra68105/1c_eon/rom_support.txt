MIB keys are required to support EON/ESMT parts on CSRA68105 devices. There are
no EON/ESMT QSPI parts with ROM support on CSRA68105.

Although MIB keys are supplied for EN25S16B(2S) and EN25S80B(2S), they should not
be used because they require a resume to suspend delay of 5ms (according to 
their datasheets). Revised parts expected Q2/Q3 2019.
